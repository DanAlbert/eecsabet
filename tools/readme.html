<h1>Administration Tools Help</h1>
<p>
	Navigation to the tools provided with this software may be found at the top
	of the page. Many of them require you to select a course from the list
	before they are available. Do so by selecting the link for the appropriate
	course from the list. Information about each of these tools is available on
	the page for the tool itself.
</p>
<p>
	Once selected, a course's ABET syllabus information will be displayed at the
	bottom of the page. To generate a course's ABET syllabus in LaTeX format,
	click the link above the syllabus preview. To generate ABET syllabi in LaTeX
	format for all courses offered this term, use the 'Dump LaTeX Syllabi for
	All Current Courses' tool.

<h2>Checklist for Creating a Course</h2>
<p>
	There are a few tasks you must complete before an instructor will be able to
	effectively use this software. The action that will bring them into the
	process is the creation of their course instances.
</p>
<h3>A note on course instances</h3>
<p>
	A course instance is an offering of a course for a given term and
	instructor. If more than one instructor is teaching a course in a given
	term, you will need to create multiple course instances. However, if one
	instructor is theaching more than one section of a course in a given term,
	you only need to create one course instance.
</p>
<h3>Before creating a course instance</h3>
<p>
	You should not create a course instance until all of the required course
	information has been provided. CLOs, prerequisites, course content,
	learning resources, and the terms that a course is offered make up the
	required course information. Below is the recommended order in which you
	provide course information. Once you begin with Create a Course, you will be
	guided through the process by each page.
</p>
<ol>
	<li><a href="course/index.php">Create a Course</a></li>
	<li>Create and Modify CLOs</li>
	<li>Add Course Content</li>
	<li>Add Learning Resources</li>
	<li>Select Terms this Course is Offered</li>
	<li>Select Course Prerequisites</li>
</ol>
<h3>A note on prerequisites</h3>
<p>
	A course needs to exist in the database before it can be added as a
	prerequisite. For this reason, it is best to work your way up from the lower
	level courses. If you need to add a course that will not be used beyond its
	participation as a prerequisite (ex. MTH 256), you should create the
	prerequisite course and	skip the rest of its configuration.
</p>
<h3>Creating a course instance</h3>
<p>
	Once you have created the course and filled out all of the required
	information, ensure that you have <a href="instructor/index.php">added the
	appropriate instructors</a> and then
	<a href="course-instance/index.php">create the course instances</a>. Once
	you create the course instance, the instructor will be mailed a link to the
	assessment page for their course.
