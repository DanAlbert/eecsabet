<h1>Course Instance Tools Help</h1>
<p>
	A course isntance represents a term that a course will be taught, with an
	associated instructor. Each course instance will have its own set of
	assessment information. <strong>Be sure to enter all course information
	before creating the course instances</strong>, as you will not be able to
	easily modify them afterward.
</p>
<h2>Creating a New Course Instance</h2>
<p>
	Select the course title, instructor and term. Click 'Create New Course
	Instance'. If you need to modify or delete a course instance, contact this
	website's administrator.
