<h1>EECS ABET Tools</h1>
<h2>At the Beginning of the Term</h2>
<p>
	At the beginning of the term you will be required to provide assessment
	information for each CLO targeted by your course. Underneath the course
	information listed at the top of the page, you will see a list of CLOs.
	If there are any curriculum improvement messages for a program outcome
	assessed by a CLO, they will be listed below that CLO. Below that, you will
	find assessment information from the last term that this course was taught.
</p>
<p>
	Fill in the assessment method and satisfactory scores for each CLO. If a CLO
	is assessed in more than one area of the course, click the button below the
	table to add another row. Finally, you will be required to fill in the
	comment box below all of the CLOs. If you have no input, just say "None."
	Once finished, click the 'Approve Button'.
</p>
<h2>After Approval</h2>
<p>
	After initially approving your course information, you may still update it
	as necessary. The form will behave precisely as before, except you are able
	to remove previously approved assessment methods from each CLO if need be.
</p>
<h2>Finalizing a Course</h2>
<p>
	When your course information is ready to be finalized, all of the assessment
	fields will be made available. Fill in every field: method, mean, median,
	high score, satisfactory score and all of the comment fields. Once certain
	you are done, click finalize. <strong>Finalizing your course information
	will prevent you from further editing any information.</strong>
</p>
<h2>Lose the Email?</h2>
<p>
	If you are unable to find the email containing the links to your courses,
	you can have it resent using the form found <a href="index.php">here</a>.
